## FAQ

### Why is it called MundOS?

My favorite video game series is the [Elder Scrolls](https://elderscrolls.bethesda.net/) series. In the game world, [Mundus](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Lore:Mundus) is the plane of existence that holds the main planet where the games take place. So MundOS is a play on Mundus. Given that the OS holds the user-space programs that run, it kind of makes sense.

### Why Rust?

Mostly I started using Rust to gain more experience with it. I have written a lot of C code already for operating systems classes in my master's program so wanted to try something new for my OS. In addition, I believe Rust is the systems language of the future, adding fuel to my desire to learn more about it.

### Are you following the above [tutorials](https://os.phil-opp.com/) exactly?

For the most part, though there are a few changes and additions I've made so far.

### Will you continue development after you complete the tutorials?

Absolutely!
